# Test Project

This is a messy, experimental project we're using to test stuff.

It's not meant to be useful, clean, or production-ready. Just random code, ideas, and experiments.

Use at your own risk. Or don't. It's probably broken anyway.

# things to add in the future : 
-php/sql login system
-better visuals
